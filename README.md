Purpose of this project was list the data in JSON format to display on the web-page which enables users to gather UFO data based on the 
date, place and shape of the city with definite filters. 

We used D3 Query inorder to fecilitate and enable the filtering and event change on the HTML browser.

Recommendation - We can further process the data based on the type of sighting with more granular details to filter whether the UFOs are 
sighted are bright light or speeding space ships - this data will help formulate more theoritical descriptions of common UFOs.
